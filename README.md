The [Makefile](Makefile) contains the following targets:

- `make all` - compile everything
- `make tokenize` - compile the tokenizer demo
- `make tokenize-tests` - compile the tokenizer demo
- `make shell` - compile the shell
- `make shell-tests` - run a few tests against the shell
- `make test` - compile and run all the tests
- `make clean` - perform a minimal clean-up of the source tree

Albeit some functions may not be working, this code still performs the overall basics of a shell system along with a tokenizer. Please refrain from plagerism and use this code as a form of inspiration for your own personal project.
